## 1. Introduction

This Product Test Plan describes the test strategy, test scope, and planned test activities for the ToolShop WEB product.  

The test plan is derived from the overarching Test Policy and defines how testing activities are implemented at the product level.  

The objective of this test plan is to ensure that key use cases of the web application are tested in a systematic, structured, and traceable manner.  

The focus is on business-critical and supporting e-commerce use cases as defined in the test scope.

---

## 2. Test Objectives

The main objectives of this test plan are:

- Verification of the functional requirements of the web application  
- Ensuring a stable and error-free user experience  
- Early detection of critical defects  
- Reduction of risks in key business processes (e.g. registration and checkout)  

---

## 3. Test Scope

### 3.1 In Scope

The test scope is derived from the defined use cases and focuses on business-critical (**MUST**) and supporting (**SHOULD**) functionalities.

The following use cases are covered by this test plan:

### MUST  
*(business-critical core functionalities required for the main e-commerce workflow)*

- User authentication (login, registration, password management)  
- Checkout process (cart, payment, address handling)  
- Customer account management  
- Product catalog (product overview, detail, category)  

These use cases are considered business-critical as they are essential for completing a purchase.

---

### SHOULD  
*(supporting and non-critical functionalities)*

- Product search and filtering  
- Contact forms (basic and advanced)  
- Discounts and pricing features  
- Analytics and tracking  
- Multi-language support
- Accessibility features (e.g. keyboard navigation, screen reader support)  
- Legal information (privacy policy)  
- Additional supporting features from the product backlog  

---

The classification of business-critical (**MUST**) and supporting (**SHOULD**) use cases is based on the project requirements and scope definition.

A detailed mapping of all relevant features is provided in the **Feature Classification Table** below.

### 3.2 Out of Scope

The focus of this test plan is exclusively on functional testing of the web interface.

The following areas are not part of this test plan:

- Performance testing (e.g. load and stress testing)  
- Mobile applications (focus is on web application only)  
- API testing (separate test level, not part of this plan)  
- Security testing (e.g. penetration testing)  
- Infrastructure and backend components outside the UI  
- Third-party integrations (if applicable)  

---

## 4. Test Items

The test scope focuses on the presentation layer of the system.

Covered components include:

- Angular-based web frontend  
- UI elements and user interactions  
- Client-side validation and input handling  
- UI-driven business logic (e.g. cart and pricing behavior)  

Interactions with backend services (REST API) are tested indirectly through UI-based scenarios but are not the primary focus of this test plan.

---

## 5. Test Strategy

### 5.1 Test Levels

Testing is performed on different levels:

- System Testing (main focus of this test plan)  
- System Integration Testing (covered indirectly via UI interactions)  
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT)  

System testing implicitly covers interactions between components from a user perspective.  

System integration aspects are therefore tested indirectly via end-to-end user interactions through the UI.  

Dedicated integration tests at API or service level are out of scope for this test plan.  

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is included as a test level, where predefined acceptance criteria are validated, even if executed by testers on behalf of business stakeholders.

---

### 5.2 Test Approach

The testing approach is based on:

- Risk-based testing  
- Requirements-based testing  
- Use case-based testing  

The focus is on validating user interactions and business-critical end-to-end processes of the web application.  

Additionally, regression testing is performed after changes or bug fixes to ensure that existing functionality remains stable.

---

### 5.3 Test Design Approach (T1–T5)

Test cases are designed using the T1–T5 test design model:

- T1: Happy path (standard case)  
- T2: Alternative scenarios  
- T3: Exception cases  
- T4: Negative testing  
- T5: Misuse scenarios  

Each user story is covered by a structured set of test cases based on this model.

For business-critical use cases (MUST, as defined in Section 3.1 Test Scope), at least T1, T3, and T4 test cases are defined.  

For supporting use cases (SHOULD), at least one T1 test case is defined.

Misuse cases (T5) are considered to validate system robustness and to simulate unintended or erroneous user behavior (e.g. invalid inputs or misuse of UI flows).

---

### 5.4 Test Techniques

The following test techniques are applied:

- Equivalence Partitioning  
- Boundary Value Analysis  
- Decision Table Testing  
- State Transition Testing  
- Scenario-based testing  
- Exploratory testing  

---

### 5.5 Traceability

Test cases are linked to corresponding user stories and acceptance criteria to ensure traceability.

---

### 5.6 Test Reporting and Defect Management

Test progress and results are continuously monitored and tracked using appropriate tools (e.g. GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and Trello).

Defects are systematically documented, tracked, and prioritized based on their severity and business impact.

This ensures transparency of the test process and supports effective decision-making throughout the testing lifecycle.

Defects include:

- Clear description  
- Steps to reproduce  
- Expected results  
- Actual results  
- Severity level  

---

## 6. Test Environment

Tests are performed in the following environment:

- Application: Practice Software Testing (Web)  
- Browser: Modern web browsers (e.g. Firefox)  
- Operating System: Windows-based systems  
- Internet connection required  

**URL:** https://practicesoftwaretesting.com  

---

## 7. Test Data

Typical test data is used to cover different application scenarios:

- User data (valid and invalid)  
- Password combinations with varying complexity  
- Product-related data  
- Shopping cart and checkout data  

Test data should be designed in a way that tests remain repeatable despite periodic database resets.

## 10. Risks and Assumptions

### Risks

| Risk ID | Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|--------|------|--------|------------|-----------|
| R1 | Errors in user registration may prevent access | High | Medium | Validation & boundary testing |

| R4 | Pricing/tax errors may cause inconsistencies | High | Medium | Boundary testing |

---

### Assumptions

- The test environment is stable and available  
- Requirements and user stories are correctly defined  
- External dependencies (e.g. services or APIs) function as expected  

---

## 11. Test Deliverables

The following artifacts are created:

- Product Test Plan  
- Test cases (T1–T5)  
- Test execution reports  
- Defect reports (e.g. via GitHub Issues)  
- Test summary report  

These artifacts support transparency, traceability, and quality assurance throughout the testing process.
